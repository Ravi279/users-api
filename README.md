* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
	* The application uses Crono gem to implement backround jobs. The account service key is fetched as soon as the user record is created as a callback. If the service is down for unkown reason we have a null value in the database and the Crono configuration as defined in "cronotab.rb" file kicksoff every 10.seconds to check if there are any users with no account_service_key in the database and creates a job in the background to fetch it from the service.

	* Run the below command to run the jobs created by Crono in the background.
	```
	bundle exec crono start RAILS_ENV=development
	```

	* Crono also has a WebUI and can be viewed at below address
